Main file for testing is "Data_store.ipynb". It saves all data from srim in .h5 format utilizing h5py. Another option is pyTables but it is not tested yet here.
It needs trim results in order to be tested, so, I have uploaded some. It relies on pysrim concerning python scripts such as srim.py and output.py
